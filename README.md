# Dotfiles

Some of the configuration for the software that I use.
This doesn't include _neovim_ as that's in a separate repo.

## How to use?

Clone the repo to your homedirectory.
Then, use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to "install" and "uninstall" the configurations.

**To install:**

```bash
stow ghostty
```

**To uninstall:**

```bash
stow -D ghostty
```
